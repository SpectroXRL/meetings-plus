# meetings-plus
Meetings+ is a meeting outcomes engine that transforms raw meeting transcripts into structured, system-readable outputs such as decisions, commitments, risks, and open questions.  Rather than focusing on summaries or recordings, Meetings+ treats meetings as **state-changing events** that produce actionable outcomes.
